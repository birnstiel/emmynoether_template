{"name":"Emmy Noether Programm Template","tagline":"Template for a DFG Emmy Noether Grant Proposal","body":"# Template for DFG Emmy Noether Grant Proposal\r\n*by Tilman Birnstiel*\r\n\r\nThis repository contains my own personal template for an [Emmy Noether Grant](http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/individual/emmy_noether/) proposal, based on the 2014 procedures. Included are:\r\n\r\n- the template `tex`-files for Part B *'Beschreibung des Vorhabens'* including some auxiliary files (header, abbreviations, ...).\r\n- the template for the commitment letter from the host institution.\r\n- a python script that builds the publication list based on [NASA ADS](http://adsabs.harvard.edu) bibcodes (so it will work mainly for astronomers). To make it work, edit the script to include the bib codes for all the papers you want to list and put in your last name in order to bold-face your name.\r\n- A `Makefile` that should compile everything.\r\n\r\n# Disclaimer\r\n\r\nThis repository is published under the [MIT license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birnstiel/emmynoether_template/master/LICENSE.md).\r\nUse it at own risk and make sure that you follow all the guidelines of future procedures, which might look different than this template. This is *not* an official template from the DFG.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
